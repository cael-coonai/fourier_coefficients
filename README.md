Calculates Fourier Series coefficients.

Fourier Coefficient Calculator calculates the coefficients for a Fourier Series
of a curve made up of discrete points from an input file. The calculator
generates a Fourier Series from the curve made by the linear interpolation of
those points. The calculator assumes that the points input are evenly spaced.
The coefficients are for the following form of the Fourier Series:

    f(t) = a_0/2 + Î£[a_n*cos(nt) + b_n*sin(nt)]
